# 🔧 Fix for Netlify Deployment Error

## ❌ **The Problem**
You're getting this error because Netlify is trying to deploy from a Git repository, but the `main` branch doesn't exist or isn't properly set up.

## ✅ **The Solution: Drag & Drop Deployment**

I've created a deployment package for you. Here's how to deploy it:

### **Step 1: Go to Netlify**
1. Open your browser and go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. If you don't have an account, sign up for free
3. Log in to your account

### **Step 2: Deploy via Drag & Drop**
1. On the Netlify dashboard, look for the **"Want to deploy a new site without connecting to Git?"** section
2. You'll see a large box that says **"Drag and drop your site output folder here"**
3. **Drag the file `bogota-crime-heatmap.zip`** (created in your project folder) into this box
4. Wait for the deployment to complete (usually takes 30-60 seconds)

### **Step 3: Get Your URL**
1. Once deployed, you'll get a random URL like `https://amazing-app-123.netlify.app`
2. Click on the URL to test your app
3. You can customize the URL in Site Settings → Site Details → Site Name

## 🎯 **Alternative: Manual File Upload**

If drag & drop doesn't work:

1. **Extract the zip file** to a folder
2. **Go to Netlify** → "Add new site" → "Deploy manually"
3. **Upload the extracted folder** or drag the folder contents
4. **Deploy!**

## 🔄 **For Future Updates**

Once your site is live, you can update it by:

1. **Making changes** to your local files
2. **Creating a new zip** with the updated files
3. **Dragging the new zip** to Netlify (it will replace the old version)

## 🚀 **Quick Commands for Updates**

```bash
# Create a new deployment package
zip -r bogota-crime-heatmap.zip . -x "*.git*" "*.DS_Store*" "deploy.sh" "DEPLOYMENT.md" "server.py"

# The zip file is ready to drag to Netlify!
```

## 🎉 **What You'll Get**

- ✅ **Free hosting** with HTTPS
- ✅ **Custom domain** support (optional)
- ✅ **Global CDN** for fast loading
- ✅ **Automatic SSL** certificate
- ✅ **Easy updates** via drag & drop

## 🔧 **If You Still Have Issues**

1. **Check the zip file** - make sure it contains:
   - `index.html`
   - `app.js`
   - `package.json`
   - `README.md`

2. **Try a different browser** or clear your cache

3. **Contact Netlify support** - they're very helpful!

## 📱 **Test Your Deployment**

Once deployed, test these features:
- ✅ Map loads correctly
- ✅ Heatmap displays
- ✅ Filters work
- ✅ Hover tooltips show
- ✅ Mobile responsiveness

Your Bogotá Crime Heatmap will be live and accessible to anyone with the URL! 🌍🗺️
